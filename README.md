# react-search-header-demo-app
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the usage of url query parameters
along with internal component state to manage reactive API requests on any 
input change (with debounce when typing).
Key parts of this functionality:
* SearchHeader component
* useDebounceCallback hook
* useQueryParamState hook
* useQuery (@tanstack React Query)

Another topic is how we can optimise the rendering of a long list of data with our ViewportListRender 
custom component.

## Technologies used:
* React
* TypeScript
* Material UI
* React Query
* JSONPlaceholder API (https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/) as a server.
